 A Game by Kenneth Koh
 
#For General Assembly SEI-49

It's like a rhythm game but in reverse. **AVOID** the blocks with your arrow keys.

Written in good ol' HTML, CSS and Javascript. This should work on most modern browser. 

## How to Play

**Use the arrow keys** to change the lane being selected. There are extra features not obvious on the front but I try to make it as intuitive as possible:
- Spacebar starts the game so you don't have to use your mouse
- Lane selection can be quickly changed by using the Q, W or E keys. (not yet implemented)
- You can clear the highscore by clicking on it, then clicking on the confirmation box that appears

## Next Steps

- Implement Lane change with Q, W or E.
- Invert collision logic and it is almost a rhythm game
- I wanted to add a 'all lane' obstacle requiring spacebar to hop over the obstacle, but the game ends too quickly and is hard enough as it is.
